# Arbitrage-Live-Bot

The python script uses API data to scan for live game arbitrage opportunities. Note that future games are also included, however, greater ROI is generally found in live games, but odds are subject to great fluctuations, which adds risk to making bets. 

The script automatically emails your account to notify you of an opportunity, it displays the ROI, the match, the odds for each outcome, and a hypothetical stake based on a $100 investment. Note that this does not automatically place the bets for you, this has to be done manually. 

Comments in the config.py and main.py are listed to ensure the script is run correctly.
